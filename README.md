In this study, the goal was to model the hydrological behavior of the Mouhoun watershed at Dapola using the SWAT and GR6J models. The aim was to propose effective tools for short, medium, and long-term water resource monitoring to anticipate hydrological risks. The study used estimated rainfall and temperature data from CHIRPS and JRA-55, respectively, covering the period from 1981 to 2017, as inputs for the models. These data underwent preliminary processing, which reduced discrepancies with ground observation data. Empirical Quantile-Quantile (EQM), Gamma Quantile-Quantile, and Scaling methods were used to correct the estimated data. The reference data were sourced from five (5) synoptic stations and underwent quality control to exclude potentially aberrant time series data. Generally, the quantile-quantile method proved highly effective for bias correction, particularly for improving the statistical distribution of the data.

Overall, the calibration and validation results were very satisfactory. The Nash criteria obtained during calibration were 0.82 and 0.87 for the SWAT and GR6J models, respectively, with validation values of 0.88 and 0.86 in the same order. Although these results are very satisfactory, the representation of flood flows was less accurate with the SWAT model. Flood flows were underestimated in this model, while low flows were well represented. The GR6J model also showed some limitations in representing low flows. The Wilcoxon test revealed significant heterogeneity between simulated and observed data. To further improve the quality of simulated flows, a bias correction using empirical quantile-quantile and scaling methods was applied, proving very useful. The distribution of hydrological simulations significantly improved following this processing.
